# ArduinoProject
Project Statement : The input I picked was the Arduion Uno R3 board as well as the 9V battery. For my output I chose an LED light and a single light bulb. The bulbs spell out LT, the initials of my favorite football player ever (Ladainian Tomlinson) and the the light bulbs form the shape of a lightning bult in between to represent the chargers logo.
